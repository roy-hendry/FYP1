# FYP1
My final year project for my degree in the University of Hertfordshire.

I felt like a lot of friends and family really struggled during the lockdowns that Covid-19 presented us with.
Due to this many people lost their rhythm of what kept them functioning well and productively.
My project is an application made to reward good habits and actions performed by a user by giving them a game-like experience
that will make them feel proud of those tasks they have completed.

In essense it is a to-do list which has elements of an "RPG" ("Role Playing Game").
I have a full report on why I chose this project and why I believe it has the potential to help people.
If you would like to see it send me a message.

Thanks for reading
-Roy
